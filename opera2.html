                <h5 class="mrsP">MRS. P.</h5>  <p>Good day, reverend sir.
                    <h5 class="name">DR. D</h5>  Ah, good Mrs. Partlet, I am glad to see you.  And
  your little daughter, Constance!  Why, she is quite a little
  woman, I declare!
       <h5 class="CONST">CONST. </h5> (aside)  Oh, mother, I cannot speak to him!
        <h5 class="mrsP">MRS. P.</h5>  Yes, reverend sir, she is nearly eighteen, and as
  good a girl as ever stepped.  (Aside to Dr. Daly)  Ah, sir, I'm
  afraid I shall soon lose her!
        <h5 class="name">DR. D</h5>  (aside to Mrs. Partlet)  Dear me, you pain me very
  much.  Is she delicate?
        <h5 class="mrsP">MRS. P.</h5>  Oh no, sir—I don't mean that—but young girls look
  to get married.
        <h5 class="name">DR. D</h5>   Oh, I take you.  To be sure.  But there's plenty of
  time for that.  Four or five years hence, Mrs. Partlet, four or
  five years hence.  But when the time does come, I shall have much
  pleasure in marrying her myself—
       <h5 class="CONST">CONST. </h5> (aside)  Oh, mother!
        <h5 class="name">DR. D</h5>   To some strapping young fellow in her own rank of
  life.
