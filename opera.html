            <h4>Act 1. Mrs. Partlet motions to Chorus to leave her with Constance.  Exeunt
                ladies of Chorus.</h4>
            <p>
    MRS. P.     Come, tell me all about it!  Do not fear—
                I, too, have loved; but that was long ago!
                Who is the object of your young affections?
    CONST.      Hush, mother!  He is here!  (Looking off)
  
          Enter Dr. Daly.  He is pensive and does not see them
  
    MRS. P.     (amazed)         Our reverend vicar!
    CONST.      Oh, pity me, my heart is almost broken!
    MRS. P.     My child, be comforted.  To such an union
                I shall not offer any opposition.
                Take him—he's yours!  May you and he be happy!
    CONST.      But, mother dear, he is not yours to give!
    MRS. P.     That's true, indeed!
    CONST.                       He might object!
    MRS. P.                                        He might.
                But come—take heart—I'll probe him on the subject.
                Be comforted—leave this affair to me.
                                                         (They
    withdraw.)
