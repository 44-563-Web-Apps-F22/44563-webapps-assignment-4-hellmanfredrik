            <h4>Act 1. Mrs. Partlet motions to Chorus to leave her with Constance.  Exeunt
                ladies of Chorus.</h4>
            <p>
    <h5>MRS. P.</h5>     <p>Come, tell me all about it!  Do not fear—
                I, too, have loved; but that was long ago!
                Who is the object of your young affections?</p>
            <h5> CONST.</h5>     <p> Hush, mother!  He is here!  (Looking off)
  
          Enter Dr. Daly.  He is pensive and does not see them</p>
  
        <h5> MRS. P.</h5>     </p>(amazed)         Our reverend vicar!<p>
    <h5>CONST. </h5>    <p> Oh, pity me, my heart is almost broken!</p>
<h5> MRS. P. </h5>   <p> My child, be comforted.  To such an union
                I shall not offer any opposition.
                Take him—he's yours!  May you and he be happy!</p>
            <h5> CONST.</h5>     </p> But, mother dear, he is not yours to give!</p>
        <h5>MRS. P. </h5>    <p>That's true, indeed!</p>
    <h5> CONST.   </h5>                   <p> He might object!</p>
<h5> MRS. P.    </h5>                                   <p> He might.
                But come—take heart—I'll probe him on the subject.
                Be comforted—leave this affair to me.
                                                        </p><p> (They
    withdraw.)</p>
